This kind of machine is used to cut through some thinner materials, such as rubber, foil, cloth, paper, etc. There are some differences in the processes the machines use, depending on the material they are intended to cut, but they all basically function in similar ways. These die cutting machines are used to cut out the material in a shape that you desire. In the beginning, they were used in leather factories, but later on people started using them in other manufacturing sectors, from shoe making to sticker and label cutting. However, most of the print industry turned to digital controlled knives and high-speed lasers to cut their die cut stickers. In die cutting the knives and lasers go all the way through the self-adhesive material on which the stickers are printed. In that sense, a die cut sticker is a type of sticker that is cut in a specific shape of an artwork or design.</p> <div class=heading-1>Why are Die Cut Stickers so Popular? </div><p>One of the main reasons why die cut stickers are more popular that other types of stickers is that they simply look more appealing than others even before they are applied. People love the way they are presented. One of their biggest advantages is that before sticking them on the wanted surface you can try them out without really sticking them. Just by putting them onto the object you can see how will they look when you permanently adhere them. This a good way to try out different stickers or sticker combination before making that final step in decorating your planer, laptop, phone or anything you want.</p> <p>However, the most noticeable drawback of die cut stickers is that they are harder to peel than kiss cut stickers or sticker sheets. It can be really tricky to remove the back of a die cut sticker, which can result in damaging the outline or even the printed artwork. And if you fold them really hard, it will result in a crease on the sticker which will always detach from the object that is adhered to. Besides this, another disadvantage of die cut stickers is that they don't really have any kind of protection around them, which can lead to damaging during shipment. Their edges can get ripped or crumbled if they're not properly packed.</p> <div class=heading-1>Some Creative Uses of Die Cut Stickers </div><p>Like any other type of sticker there is a huge number of ways in which die cut stickers can be used. However, the most common uses are decoration and advertisement. In the last few years people have massively started buying die cut stickers to decorate their laptops, reusable water bottles, phone cases and so on.
